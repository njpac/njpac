- 👋 Hi, I’m @njpac
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to develop, it doesn't matter front end,back end. I hope to become a full stack developer!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, and i will learn mySQL and i believe Java by the end of 2022.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that will give me insight into software development, and an idea of where i would like to specialise into within the next 3-4 years
- 📫 How to reach me: Via GitHub would be the simplest way! Im looking forward to your contact!
